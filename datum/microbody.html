<p>Microbody notes</p>
<p>A pathogen microbody identifies the cause of the disease.
Most of the real life causes for diseases have been added already.
Each microbody defines a specific characteristic for a pathogen:</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast does the infection spiral out of control on the station (mutativeness)</li>
<li>How bad will the disease eventually evolve? (maliciousness multiplier)</li>
<li>How fast is the evolution of the disease? (mutation speed multiplier)</li>
<li>How powerful is a disease caused by the microbody (stages).</li>
<li>What is a fertile soil to cultivate this pathogen? (growth medium)</li>
</ul>
<p>We differentiate between two types of cures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serum. Every microbody has a serum; there is nothing that is currently incurable. Of course not adding a cure for a specific
microbody will make all pathogens of that microbody incurable.</li>
<li>Vaccine. Currently, only virii have vaccines; injecting someone with a vaccine for a pathogen will make them immune to said
pathogen and all its mutations. A traitor would use this for his very deadly airbourne pathogen to avoid getting infected
by it.</li>
